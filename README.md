## Description  
**LatteLab** is a Python library for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations based on the **Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM)**. This project is part of my Master's Degree in Physics and aims to provide an efficient and flexible tool for LBM simulations, leveraging ***cupy*** for GPU/TPU acceleration.  

The library is **Open Source**, and contributions are highly encouraged. Whether you're an academic researcher or just curious about fluid dynamics, you're welcome to contribute!  

## Current State  
**LatteLab** is currently in **pre-alpha** version and **not yet functional**. A working **alpha version** will be available soon. Stay tuned!  

## Installation  
To use LatteLab, you will need to install specific versions of **cupy**, and [VisPy](https://github.com/vispy/vispy): 

```bash
pip install numpy==1.26.4 vispy==0.14.3
```

A PIP package installation will be available in future releases.  

## How to Use
